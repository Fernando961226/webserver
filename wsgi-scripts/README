This directory contains wsgi configuration files for the Checker
Framework Live Demo webserver.
Author: Charles Chen

==Usage==

Configure *.conf file with the deploy server info, and then copy the
*.conf file to httpd vhost dir (the vhost dir in standard httpd
installations is /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhosts ). Don't forget to
restart httpd.
 
If mod_macro module is actived in httpd, it is suggested to use
checkerweb-wsgi.conf which is easier to modify.


== File description ==

- checkerweb-wsgi.conf: Apache file for mounting checkweb to apache2
  by wsgi as virtual host. This file needs two dependencies of apache2:
  1) mod_wsgi 2) mod_macro.
  This option makes it easier to configure parameters.

- checkerweb-wsgi-without-macro.conf: this file is similar to
  checkerweb-wsgi.conf except it doesn't use macros. This file only
  depends on mod_wsgi. But it is harder to configure parameters
  because of the unavoidable hard-code-style.

- checkerweb.wsgi: wsgi script of checkerweb.
