This directory contains wsgi configuration files of CheckerFramework webserver.
author: Charles Chen

==Usage==
configure *.conf file with the deploy server info, and then copy the *.conf file to httpd vhost dir(the vhost dir in standard httpd installation would be /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhosts ). Don't forget to restart httpd.
 

If mod_macro module is actived in httpd, it is suggested to use checkerweb-wsgi.conf which is easier to modify.


==file description==
-checkerweb-wsgi.conf: apache file of mounting checkweb to apache2 by wsgi as virtual host. This file need two dependences of apache2: 1)mod_wsgi 2)mod_macro
This one is easier to configure parameters.

-checkerweb-wsgi-without-macro.conf: this file is similiar to checkerweb-wsgi.conf except it doesn't use macro. This file only dependent on mod_wsgi. But it is harder to configure parameters because of the unavoidable hard-code-style.

-checkerweb.wsgi: wsgi script of checkerweb.
