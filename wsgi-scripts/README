author: Charles Chen

==Usage==
configure .conf file with the deploy server info, and then copy the .conf file to httpd server vhost dir.

==file description==
-checkerweb-wsgi.conf: apache file of mounting checkweb to apache2 by wsgi as virtual host. This file need two dependences of apache2: 1)mod_wsgi 2)mod_macro
This one is easier to configure parameters.

-checkerweb-wsgi-without-macro.conf: this file is similiar to checkerweb-wsgi.conf except it doesn't use macro. This file only dependent on mod_wsgi. But it is harder to configure parameters because of the unavoidable hard-code-style.

-checkerweb.wsgi: wsgi script of checkerweb.
